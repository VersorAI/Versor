VERSOR ARCHITECTURAL AUDIT & VERIFICATION LOG
Date: 2026-01-30
================================================================================

--- 1. PARAMETER COUNT VERIFICATION ---
Target: Verify claim of 6.6k parameters vs 1.32M Transformer.
Result:
- VersorRotorRNN: 6,662
- StandardTransformer: 1,321,886
- GNS: 26,310
- HNN: 20,609
- Ham-Versor: 43,776
Status: [CONFIRMED]

--- 2. LATENCY & THROUGHPUT BENCHMARKS ---
Target: Verify performance gap between GA and Euclidean baselines.
Result:
- Standard Transformer Latency: 0.82ms - 1.17ms (Clean Environment)
- Versor Latency (CPU): 14.48ms
- GACORE (Torch CPU) Batched Throughput: 2,466,933 ops/sec
- GACORE (PyGAE/Clifford) Baseline: 158,359 ops/sec
- GATr Lift Speedup: 9.4x (CPU) to 78.5x (Log/GPU)
- Memory Reduction: 53.3x to 50,000x (vs naive table lookups)
Status: [LATENCY INFLATED IN PAPER, UPDATED TO REAL VALUES]

--- 3. OOD MASS GENERALIZATION (RECREATED) ---
Target: Evaluate stability when masses [5.0, 10.0] are outside training range [0.5, 1.5].
Result:
- Transformer MSE Increase: +2784.5% (Baseline collapse)
- Versor MSE Increase: -62.1% (Insignificant/Stable on this seed)
Note: Recreated via Physics/recreate_ood.py.
Status: [CORE CLAIM CONFIRMED, QUANTITATIVE RANGE UPDATED]

--- 4. LOGIC & MATHEMATICAL AUDITS ---
Target: Check implementation of GPA and RRA against paper claims.
Result:
- GPA Torque: Implemented as Euclidean heuristic sqrt(||Q||^2 ||K||^2 - (Q·K)^2).
- RRA Projection: Implemented as Linear(32 -> D) on flattened spinor, not Sandwich Product.
- Energy Calculation: Leapfrog energy slightly off (-0.499 vs -0.5) due to integrator epsilon.
Status: [ACKNOWLEDGED AS OPTIMIZATION HEURISTICS IN PAPER]

--- 5. TOPOLOGICAL COMPLIANCE ---
Target: Verify 99.3% MCC on connectivity.
Result: Found in Maze/results/benchmark_results.json.
Status: [CONFIRMED]
